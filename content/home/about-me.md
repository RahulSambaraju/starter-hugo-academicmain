I'm Dr Rahul Sambaraju - a social psychologist working as a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the University of Edinburgh, UK. I use discursive approaches to examine social categorization and identities in their intersections with social exclusion. I examine such processes in the case of racial identities, migrant identities, nations and nationalism, and caste. I have published widely on these topics and currently offer a seminar course on Decolonizing Psychology.
