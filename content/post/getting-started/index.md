## Overview of research

My work on race and racism takes a social/discursive constructionist approach. This means that I examine how race categories and relatedly, racism are constructed in specific interactional, and socio-cultural settings. The former focus is rooted in discursive psychology and the latter in critical and decolonial approaches. Successfully bringing these together is an ongoing task. Below, I outline my work on race and racism

* Using membership categorization analysis I examine how race categories are constructed and used to make negotiate racism. The crux of this work is to show how race categories are used in various ways to negotiate [culpability ](https://doi.org/10.1111/bjso.12490)for racist actions or suppress the relevance for racism. I show that victim categories can be reformulated as [victim categories](https://doi.org/10.1002/ejsp.2751) in negotiating whether 'racism' is salient for discrimination against Black persons in India.
