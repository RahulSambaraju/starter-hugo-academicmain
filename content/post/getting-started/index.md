## Overview of research

My work on race and racism takes a social/discursive constructionist approach. This means that I examine how race categories and relatedly, racism are constructed in specific interactional, and socio-cultural settings. The former focus is rooted in discursive psychology and the latter in critical and decolonial approaches. Successfully bringing these together is an ongoing task. Below, I outline my work on race and racism

1. Using membership categorization analysis I examine how race categories are constructed and used to make negotiate racism. The crux of this work is to show how race categories are used in various ways to negotiate [culpability ](https://doi.org/10.1111/bjso.12490)for racist actions or suppress the relevance for racism. I show that victim categories can be reformulated as [victim categories](https://doi.org/10.1002/ejsp.2751) in negotiating whether 'racism' is salient for discrimination against Black persons in India. My current work examines the construction and formulation of race categories in negotiating support for teaching [Critical Race Theories](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4426535) in US public schools.[](https://wowchemy.com)
2. Along with Prof Natasha Shrikant I have developed [innovative ](https://doi.org/10.1080/14780887.2023.2245348)ways to examine race categories using membership categorization analysis, which accommodate social salience of race.
3. I﻿ examine how claims about that certain events or actions are racist are made, taken-up, and accepted or rejected. I show that such claims are tied to entitlements to [knowing ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344840260_Epistemic_issues_in_Black_peoples'_accounts_of_racism_in_India_1_'I've_had_women_just_scream_because_they_saw_me_comin'_Some_epistemic_issues_in_Black_peoples'_accounts_of_racism_in_India)or experiences of racism, which are legitimately had for those who are [migrants ](https://doi.org/10.1002/ejsp.2539)or are othered and are seen as lacking for those in the majority groups. 
4. I have shown how complaints about racism are made in online spaces like [Twitter ](https://doi.org/10.1177/0261927X211048215)and responded with 'anti-racist' actions.
5. I﻿ have contributed to debates on examining race and racism in social psychology through lead editing a special issue on '[Mobilizing race and racism](https://doi.org/10.1111/bjso.12502)' for the British Journal of Social Psychology along with Prof Chris McVittie.
6. Further I have discussed how understandings of race and racism in erstwhile colonized spaces can inform broader social psychological theorizing of race and racism.
