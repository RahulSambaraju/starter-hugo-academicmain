bio: I'm Dr Rahul Sambaraju - a social psychologist working as a Lecturer
  (Assistant Professor) in the University of Edinburgh, UK. I use discursive
  approaches to examine social categorization and identities in their
  intersections with social exclusion. I examine such processes in the case of
  racial identities, migrant identities, nations and nationalism, and caste. I
  have published widely on these topics and currently offer a seminar course on
  Decolonizing Psychology.
